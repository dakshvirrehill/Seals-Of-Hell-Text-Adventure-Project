Black Ring
All Powerful Ring of Famine

Starving and Thirsty People
We are dying of thirst
Can't open the gateway without quenching our thirst
Elixir quenched their thirst and they opened the gateway

Black Horseman
The embodiment of famine, ruling earth through draught and famine
Tries to suck all nutrition and electrolytes out of your body
The shield replenishes the sucked nutrition and electrolytes
She rides away on her horse, cursing you to a lifetime of disappointment but leaving an important piece behind

Realm of Famine
The kingdom of starvation has begun

Gates of Starvation
The only way out is by feeding the needy

Maze of Draught Entry
The destruction of famine has begun

Maze of Draught Dead End 
Nothing here

Endless Draught Entrance
The only way to reach famine is go through famine

Maze of Draught 
Pathway through Draught

Maze of Draught Exit
You have reached the end of draught by famine

Tar Room
The room of famine
