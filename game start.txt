Lucifer Morningstar
The devil himself, guarding the gates of hell
Stares deep into your soul, killing your strength from within
The shield protects you from the devil's stare
The devil frowns and returns to the depths of hell planning and plotting his next return

Seals of Hell
The Apocalypse is upon us. The Seven Seals of Hell have been opened and the Gates of Hell have unleashed all kinds of demons into the world. Save us, Oh! Mighty Hero by going into the depths of hell and fighting the worst of the worst to seal the gates again and stop the apocalypse.

Underworld
The beginning and the end of the labyrinth of hell

Hell's Gates
The start and the stop of the apocalypse

The Gates of Hell
Apocalypse is upon us as the seals are broken and the gate is open
The devil is angry and is going to stop you from stopping the apocalypse
You have successfully sealed the gates of hell and stopped the apocalypse
